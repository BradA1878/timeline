# Articulate JS Tech Challenge

This tech challenge is your chance to demonstrate all of your JS
knowledge and show off how you structure and test your code.

You'll be building a small timeline application where you get
some data about people and some various events in their lives,
and then display those events on a timeline that can be played
back, paused, and seeked.

## Things we're looking for

- How well your app works, of course
- How you structure your code
- How you test your code and how thoroughly you test it

Because we want to see your overall JS skills for this, we're
limiting the tools you can use to the lightweight [Backbone][backbone],
[Underscore][underscore], and [jQuery][jquery], plus [RequireJS][requirejs]
for loading code. You can use any or all of these—by all means
write vanilla JS if you're more comfortable with that than these
tools. We chose these because they're tools we use and because we
want to see how well you structure your code outside of a framework.

For testing, we've set up [Jasmine][jasmine] for you. Feel free to
change the setup or replace it with a framework of your choosing.

## General instructions

1. Fork this repo
1. Clone it to your computer
1. Install [node][node] if you haven't already
1. Install [grunt][grunt] if you haven't already
1. Run `npm install` to set everything up
1. Run `grunt` to start a simple server that will
   host your app. It will also rerun your tests
   for you as you change your code.
1. Build the app
1. Email us a link to your repo when you're done

Feel free to change any of the tools here, such as replacing
[grunt][grunt] with [gulp][gulp] if you like, using a simple
python server instead of the bundled [express][express] server,
etc. But if you do change anything, please be sure to update
your README so we can easily run your application.

## App features

Use the wireframe below as your guide to the app's features.
If you have any major questions, by all means email us.
If you have questions about feature specifics, feel free to
implement what you think makes sense and explain why you made the
choice that you made. Many details will be up to you.

### A few notes and requirements

- You cannot change the supplied data at all. It may not be
  formatted the way you want and it may be inconsistent—you'll
  need to figure out how to deal with that in your app.
- You cannot use any additional libraries than those provided.
- Your app only needs to work in the latest Chrome.
- All of your tests should be passing upon submission.
- **You must have fun doing this** :dancer: :dancers: :smile:
