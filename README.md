# Articulate JS Tech Challenge

This tech challenge is your chance to demonstrate all of your JS
knowledge and show off how you structure and test your code.

You'll be building a small timeline application where you get
some data about people and some various events in their lives,
and then display those events on a timeline that can be played
back, paused, and reset.

## Things we're looking for

- How well your app works, of course
- How you structure your code
- How you test your code and how thoroughly you test it

Because we want to see your overall JS skills for this, we're
limiting the tools you can use to the lightweight [Backbone][backbone],
[Underscore][underscore], and [jQuery][jquery], plus [RequireJS][requirejs]
for loading code. You can use any or all of these, but by all means
write vanilla JS if you're more comfortable with that than these
tools. We chose these because they're tools we use and because we
want to see how well you structure your code outside of a framework.

## General instructions

1. Fork this repo
1. Clone it to your computer
1. Build the app
1. Push to your repo
1. Email us a link to your repo when you're done

## App features

The Timeline should take 2 seconds per year, and change for every event.
A simple div which changes content will suffice. Also, a button which
changes with the state of the timeline (play when paused, pause when
playing, reset when finished) and which responds to clicks. You may style
the button if you like, but simple text ("play"/"pause"/"reset") is enough.

### A few notes and requirements

- You cannot change the supplied data at all.
- Your app only needs to work in the latest Chrome.
- All of your code should be thoroughly tested and all tests should be passing upon submission.
- **You must have fun doing this** :dancer: :dancers: :smile:
